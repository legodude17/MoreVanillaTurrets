# More Vanilla Turrets for Rimworld 1.1

Version: 1.92
A little mod that adds eight carefully balanced turret variations, each unique in its own way while matching the vanilla art style.

Original by Marn, updated to 1.1 by legodude17.

I only made a couple very small changes to make it function in 1.1, all credit goes to Marn.
